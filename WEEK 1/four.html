<h1><b> <u>INTRODUCTION:</u> </b></h1>

<p> <b>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) </b>are two core technologies used for creating and styling websites. Here's a brief overview of HTML and CSS:<br>


<br><b> HTML </b>is the standard markup language used to structure the content of a web page. It consists of a series of elements or tags that define the structure and semantics of the content.
<br><b>HTML </b>tags are enclosed in angle brackets <b>("<>" and "</>") </b>and are used to mark up different elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, tables, forms, and more.
<br><b> HTML</b> provides the foundation for organizing and presenting the content on a web page, but it does not handle the visual appearance or styling of the elements.</p>


<h1> <u>CSS: </u></h1>

<br><b>CSS </b>is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML (or XML).
<br><b>CSS </b>allows you to separate the presentation and layout of a web page from its structure. It enables you to control the visual aspects such as colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, and more.
<br><b>CSS </b>works by associating style rules with HTML elements. These style rules define how specific elements should be displayed on the web page.
<br><b>CSS </b>offers various selectors that target specific elements, classes, or IDs, allowing you to apply different styles to different parts of the HTML document.
<br><b>CSS </b>can be applied to HTML documents in different ways, such as inline styles, internal stylesheets, and external stylesheets.


<p>By using HTML and CSS together, you can create visually appealing and well-structured web pages. HTML defines the structure and content, while CSS adds the presentation and styling to enhance the visual appearance of the web page.</p>
