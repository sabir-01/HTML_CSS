       <br> Chickpea bolognese is a delicious and hearty vegetarian or vegan alternative to the classic meat-based Bolognese sauce. It replaces the ground meat with chickpeas for a protein-rich and flavorful dish. Here's a recipe for chickpea bolognese:
<br>
       <br> Ingredients:
       <br> - 2 tablespoons olive oil
       <br> - 1 onion, diced
       <br> - 2 carrots, diced
       <br> - 2 celery stalks, diced
       <br> - 3 cloves of garlic, minced
       <br> - 1 can (14 ounces or 400g) crushed tomatoes
       <br> - 1 can (14 ounces or 400g) chickpeas, drained and rinsed
       <br> - 1 teaspoon dried basil
       <br> - 1 teaspoon dried oregano
       <br> - 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
       <br> - 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
       <br> - Salt and pepper to taste
       <br> - 1/2 cup vegetable broth or water
       <br> - 8 ounces (225g) pasta of your choice
       <br> - Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)
       <br> 
       <br> Instructions:
       <br> 1. In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
       <br> 2. Add the diced onion, carrots, and celery to the skillet and sauté for about 5 minutes until the vegetables start to soften.
       <br> 3. Add the minced garlic and sauté for another minute until fragrant.
       <br> 4. Pour in the crushed tomatoes and stir in the dried basil, dried oregano, dried thyme, red pepper flakes (if using), salt, and pepper.
       <br> 5. Add the drained and rinsed chickpeas to the skillet and stir to combine.
       <br> 6. Pour in the vegetable broth or water to loosen the sauce and bring it to a simmer.
       <br> 7. Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld together and the sauce to thicken.
       <br> 8. While the sauce is simmering, cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
       <br> 9. Once the sauce has thickened, taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.
       <br> 10. Serve the chickpea bolognese sauce over the cooked pasta.
       <br> 11. Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired.
       <br> 12. Enjoy your flavorful and satisfying chickpea bolognese!
