       <br> Beef biryani is a delicious and aromatic rice dish made with beef and a blend of spices. Here's a recipe for beef biryani:
<br>
       <br> Ingredients:
       <br> - 2 cups basmati rice
       <br> - 1 lb (450g) beef, cut into bite-sized pieces
       <br> - 1 large onion, thinly sliced
       <br> - 2 tomatoes, chopped
       <br> - 4 cloves of garlic, minced
       <br> - 1-inch piece of ginger, grated
       <br> - 2 green chilies, slit lengthwise (adjust to taste)
       <br> - 1/2 cup plain yogurt
       <br> - 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
       <br> - 1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
       <br> - 1 teaspoon garam masala
       <br> - 1 teaspoon biryani masala (optional)
       <br> - A few strands of saffron soaked in 2 tablespoons of warm milk
       <br> - Fresh cilantro leaves, chopped (for garnish)
       <br> - Fresh mint leaves, chopped (for garnish)
       <br> - Cooking oil or ghee (clarified butter)
       <br> - Salt to taste
       <br> 
       <br> Instructions:
       <br> 1. Wash the basmati rice under running water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes, then drain.
       <br> 2. In a large pot, heat some oil or ghee over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook until they turn golden brown and caramelized. Remove half of the onions from the pot and set them aside for garnishing.
       <br> 3. To the remaining onions in the pot, add the minced garlic, grated ginger, and green chilies. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.
       <br> 4. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and mushy.
       <br> 5. Add the beef pieces to the pot and cook until they are browned on all sides.
       <br> 6. In a bowl, whisk together the yogurt, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, biryani masala (if using), and salt. Pour this mixture over the beef and mix well to coat the beef evenly.
       <br> 7. Add water to the pot, enough to cook the rice. For every cup of rice, use 1.5 cups of water. Bring the water to a boil.
       <br> 8. Drain the soaked rice and add it to the boiling water. Cook the rice on medium heat until it is 70-80% cooked. The grains should still have a slight bite to them. Drain the rice and set it aside.
       <br> 9. Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C).
       <br> 10. In a large oven-safe dish or a deep, oven-safe pot, layer the partially cooked rice and the beef masala mixture. Start with a layer of rice, then add a layer of beef masala, and repeat until all the rice and beef are used. The top layer should be rice.
       <br> 11. Drizzle the saffron milk over the top layer of rice and garnish with the reserved caramelized onions, chopped cilantro, and mint leaves.
       <br> 12. Cover the dish with a tight-fitting lid or aluminum foil and place it in the preheated oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the flavors meld together and the rice is fully cooked.
       <br> 13. Remove from the oven and let it sit for a few minutes. Gently fluff the rice with a fork before serving.
       <br> 14. Serve the beef biryani hot with raita (yogurt sauce) or a side salad.
       <br> 
       <br> Enjoy your flavorful beef biryani!
