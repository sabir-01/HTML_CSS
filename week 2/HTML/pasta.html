        <br>5. Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld together.
        <br>6. Add the cooked pasta to the tomato sauce and toss until the pasta is evenly coated.
        <br>7. Remove from heat and serve the pasta in bowls.
        <br>8. If desired, top with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves for extra flavor and garnish.

        <br>Note: This recipe serves as a basic foundation, and you can customize it by adding cooked meat, vegetables, or other ingredients to the sauce. Feel free to experiment with different types of pasta shapes and variations of sauces to create your own favorite pasta dishes.
